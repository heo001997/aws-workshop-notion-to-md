<details>
<summary>Why don’t we trigger a save on each Notion page change?</summary>

⇒ Notion doesn’t support this kind of trigger, and I haven’t found any workaround for it.


</details>

<details>
<summary>How can I change Thumbnail and Favicon images?</summary>

⇒ Check section **“IV. Level 3 - Notion to Hugo Relearn (on GitHub Pages)” → “5. (Optional) Add thumbnail & favicon.”**


</details>

<details>
<summary>I don’t want each Heading to create a new page. How can I avoid this?</summary>

⇒ A new page will always be created for each Heading. You can prevent this by using any other Notion block type, such as Bullet points or Text, instead of Headings.


</details>

<details>
<summary>Why aren’t there more configuration options?</summary>

⇒ This is a side project I worked on while doing my [**AWS First Cloud Journey**](https://cloudjourney.awsstudygroup.com/) course, so I didn’t have much time to add more features. I built it mainly for my personal use, so the current options are sufficient for me.


</details>

<details>
<summary>I want to contribute features. Is this project open-source?</summary>

⇒ Yes, this project is completely open-source, and you’re very [welcome to contribute here](https://github.com/heo001997/notion-to-markdown).


</details>

<details>
<summary>Is my credential safe?</summary>

⇒ Completely safe. We don’t store any of your credentials, and you can double-check our codebase if you’d like.


</details>

<details>
<summary>Where can I report bugs, and how can I fix them?</summary>

⇒ You’re [welcome to open an issue here](https://github.com/heo001997/notion-to-markdown). Alternatively, you can submit a PR (pull request) to fix the issue by yourself.


</details>

<details>
<summary>Don’t you think the code looks pretty bad?</summary>

⇒ You tell me! That’s the best I could do with an AI coder. I created this workshop and set everything up within a week. Feel free to refactor it for me or create a fork.
