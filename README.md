# AWS Workshop - Site-to-Site Vpn Connections

AWS Site-to-Site VPN Connections Workshop: http://aws-s2s.bamidev.com/

This repo is re-formatted from [my original workshop written in Notion](https://mybamidev.notion.site/Workshop-Site-to-Site-VPN-AWS-to-Datacenter-71a230664cf04e3cae7c1cecd2e6c465?pvs=74).

I apply the following changes:
  1. Added Hugo to the repo to generate the website
  2. Added Notion sync to the repo to keep the website up to date with the workshop
  3. Added custom Hugo action to fast show architecture diagram

Hope you enjoy the workshop!
